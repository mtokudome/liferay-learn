# Multifactor Authentication

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is required for all Analytics Cloud users. This updated system provides multiple factors or layers of security for login. While each authentication method has strengths and weaknesses, a system that uses two or more factors are considered stronger and more robust.

The use of MFA can protect users from different cyberattacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

## Setting up Multifactor Authentication

To set up MFA,

1. Login to [analytics.liferay.com](https://analytics.liferay.com) with your [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com) account email address.

1. Choose from one of the five MFA options. For example, select *SMS Authentication* to receive a code by text message.

   Note, if you choose to change to a different authentication type after setup, please [contact support](#help-with-mfa).
   

1. Click on the *Send Code* button and wait to receive your code. Note, you may need to check your spam folder if using the *Email Authentication* option.

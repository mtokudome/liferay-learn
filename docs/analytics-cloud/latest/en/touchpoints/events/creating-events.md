# Creating Events

Track and analyze custom events with Analytics Cloud. Note that events and associated attributes must be first set up and managed in Workspace Data. See [Managing Events](../workspace-data/managing-events.md).

To being tracking a new custom event,

1. Navigate to Touchpoints &rarr; Events.

1. Click the "+" icon to add a new event.

1. A pop-up form will list all the available events. Click on Default or Custom to narrow your selection. Or use the search bar to find a specific event.

1. Click Save and the event is now in the list of tracked events.

Note that there is a limit of 100 custom events, 25 attributes per event, and a 50 character limit per event/attribute.

From the list of tracked events, click on a specific event to [Analyze Events](./analyze-events.md)

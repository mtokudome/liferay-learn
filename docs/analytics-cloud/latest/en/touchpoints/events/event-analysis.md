# Event Analysis

As individuals visit and interact with your site, these events are recorded by Analytics Cloud. Many of the events that take place on your Liferay DXP instance are set up to be tracked out-of-the-box. Custom events can also be defined and tracked through the use of code snippets added to your site. Select these different events and analyze the interactions based on different attributes with the event analysis tool.

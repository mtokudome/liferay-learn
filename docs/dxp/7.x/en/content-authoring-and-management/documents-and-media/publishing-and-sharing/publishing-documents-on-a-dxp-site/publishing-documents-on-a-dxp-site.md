# Publishing Documents on a DXP Site

Liferay DXP makes it easy to publish and showcase documents and other types of media files. As you begin [uploading media files](../../uploading-and-managing/uploading-files.md), you probably want to start sharing them on your site.

There are different widgets that are available to use to highlight your documents and media files: The *Media Gallery* widget, the *Documents and Media* widget, and the *Asset Publisher* widget. You can choose an appropriate widget based on the type of media you have.

Documents and media files can also be embedded and displayed on other types of DXP assets such as Web Content, Blogs, or Wiki Pages.

## Using the Media Gallery Widget 

The *Media Gallery* widget publishes your media in a simple gallery-like style. It shows a large thumbnail of each media file, lets the user download files, and has slideshow capabilities. A common way to use the *Media Gallery* is to have a separate page for displaying media and add a *Media Gallery* widget to it. The widget does not display `.doc` files.

To use the *Media Gallery* widget:

1. Navigate to an existing page where you wish to add the *Media Gallery* widget. Click on the *Add App* icon (![Click on the Add App icon to add a new widget.](../../../images/icon-add-app.png)) at the top of the page.

    Or [create a new page](../../../site-building/creating-pages/adding-paged.md) on which to add the widget.

2. The *Media Gallery* widget is found under the Content Management section of the list of widgets. It can also be found by searching for *Media Gallery*.

    ![Locate the Media Gallery widget listed under the Content Management section of widgets.](images/01.png)

3. Drag the widget onto your page. Any media files previously uploaded should already be visible. If you wish to [add additional media files](../../uploading-and-managing/uploading-files.md), they can be uploaded from the *Documents and Media* Application.

4. Configure the widget by clicking on the *Options* button (![Click on the Options button at the top-right corner of the widget for configuration.](../../../images/icon-options.png)) at the top-right corner of the widget.

5. Select *Configuration* and the Configuration window will appear.

    ![The configuration window has four different tabs.](images/02.png)

    Under the Setup tab, there are a few options to configure:

    * Display Settings - This allows you to show each file’s actions, filter the media types to display, and choose a display template for your media.

    * Folders Listing - This allows you to select a Document Library folder to serve as the root folder from which to display files. The root folder you select becomes the highest-level folder the widget can access. 

    Click *Save* to save your changes. Click *Cancel* to return to the widget without saving changes.

6. Once you've added your media files and finished configuring, you can view the widget on your page. Clicking on any media file automatically starts a slideshow of all the files.

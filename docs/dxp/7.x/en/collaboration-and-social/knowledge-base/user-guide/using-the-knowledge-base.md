# Using the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base app can be used to display professional product documentation or form complete books or guides. It even lets you import article source files written in Markdown. It’s [workflow-enabled](../../../process-automation/workflow/user-guide/introduction-to-workflow.md), so you can require articles to be approved before publication. Additionally, you can create [article templates](knowledge-base-templates.md) that help users follow a common outline.

Here are the Knowledge Base’s key features:

* Navigation is built into Knowledge Base Display.
* The suggestions interface enables user feedback on articles.
* Articles are stored in folders.
* Metadata fields exist for the friendly URL, source URL, categorization, and related assets.
* The Edit on GitHub button (![GitHub button](./using-the-knowledge-base/images/01.png)) can take readers to an article’s source repository location (if you choose to use it that way).
* Markdown source files can be imported to create and update articles.

The Knowledge Base has several widgets you can add to site pages:

* [Knowledge Base Display](knowledge-base-display-widget.md)
* [Knowledge Base Article](other-knowledge-base-widgets.md#knowledge-base-article-widget)
* [Knowledge Base Section](other-knowledge-base-widgets.md#knowledge-base-section-widget)
* [Knowledge Base Search](other-knowledge-base-widgets.md#knowledge-base-search-widget)
